The **PSRG QSO Party** is a month-long event to encourage contact between members of the Puget Sound Repeater Group outside of nets and without the use of the repeater, thereby practicing and promoting the radio art and building our community.

**The PSRG QSO Party will begin on July 23rd at midnight Pacific time, and end on August 23rd at midnight.**


## Rules

1. **Eligibility**. All members of the Puget Sound Repeater Group are eligible to participate. 
2. **Exchange**. The exchange must include your name and an [RS(T) signal report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-S-T_system).
3. **Modes**. Contacts must be made between two members of the PSRG, in simplex mode (without the use of any repeater), on any band and in any mode.
4. **Internet and digital contacts**. Echolink, Allstar, DMR, and DSTAR contacts are valid so long as they are direct, and not via a repeater, link, or conference. Digital contacts are fine as long as the exchange includes name and RST. For example, with FT8, this means moving away from the normal macros and including your name; the FT8 signal report is fine.
5. **Skeds**. Arranging your QSO beforehand, on the repeater or otherwise, is perfectly fine. However, contacts on the Double Nickel Simplex Net don’t count, as they are part of a net and not standard simplex contacts.



## Example exchange

This is a minimal contact, which includes the required name, RS(T), and grid square exchange. Feel free to chat about anything and everything !

- **Station 1** : CQ PSRG, CQ PSRG. This is K7DRQ, calling CQ PSRG.
- **Station 2** : K7DRQ, this is KI7RMU.
- **Station 1** : KI7RMU, this is K7DRQ. You’re coming in loud and clear, you’re a 5 by 9. My name is Quentin ! Back to you, KI7RMU.
- **Station 2** : Hi Quentin, I’m Jack. You’re a little in the noise, you’re probably 3 by 5. How do you copy ?
- **Station 1** : Thanks Jack, good copy. Thanks for the contact, and 73 ! KI7RMU, this is K7DRQ.
- **Station 2** : Sounds good ! Wishing you 73, K7DRQ, from KI7RMU. I’ll be clear.



## Scoring

**One point** is awarded per unique contact, per band, per mode.



## Logging

Logs should contain :

- **exchange info** (other station’s callsign, name, and their RST report for you)
- **band and mode** information
- **the date and time** ( in Pacific time or in UTC ) of the contact.

As an example :

| Date          | Time  | Callsign | Name | RST | Band | Mode |

To make it easier to tally points and merge everyone’s logs, please use a spreadsheet for logging. You’re very welcome to use any logger program you prefer, if it can output to CSV or Excel formats. Send logs to [k7drq@psrg.org](mailto:k7drq@psrg.org) for scoring ! The [leaderboard](leaderboard) will be updated regularly.

Logs must be returned to K7DRQ by August 3rd to qualify.
